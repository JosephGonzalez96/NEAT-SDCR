## NEAT implementation
This code is an implementation of the NEAT algorithm proposed by Stanley [in his paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). The original algorithm uses sexual reproduction and it is the **neat_sexual.c** file, this work proposes **neat_asexual.c** as a better alternative, the document is available on [this website](https://sites.google.com/site/degreethesislorenaguachi/2020-joseph-gonzalez-self-driving-mini-robot-using-neat-algorithm).
