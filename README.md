## NEAT implementation
This code is an implementation of the NEAT algorithm proposed by Stanley [in his paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf). The original algorithm uses sexual reproduction, and it is the **neat_sexual.c** file, this work proposes **neat_asexual.c** as a better alternative. The document is available on [this website](https://sites.google.com/site/degreethesislorenaguachi/2020-joseph-gonzalez-self-driving-mini-robot-using-neat-algorithm). 


You can compile the **neat_sexual.c** file using the command 
```bash
gcc neat_sexual.c -o neat -lm
```
and the **neat_asexual.c** file using the command
```bash
gcc neat_asexual.c -o neat -lm
```
after training, the genome.txt and the resume.txt file will be generated, these files show a summary of the best neural network in each generation, and the
